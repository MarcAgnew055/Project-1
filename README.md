## Which three Crypto assets show the most stability and least risk?  
Bitcoin, Litcoin and Etherieum. This conclusion was drawn taking into account technical analysis of historical data. The anualized standard deviation of daily returns was very helpful in determining this. Additonaly sharp ratios, beta (relative to bitcoin) and daily return rolling analysis were helpful. 
## Which Crypto asset shows the most volatility and has greatest risk?  
Dogecoin. This asset has huge spikes in volume and daily close prices that are directly correlated with non-fundamental factors of the asset such as tweets by Elon Musk. 
## How do alternative coins stack up in volitivity against bitcoin?  
Using the rolling beta analysis chart, annualized standard deviation of daily returns chart most alternative cryptocurrncies are more volatile than bitcoin. The beta analysis with a value greater than 1 indicates thatthe asset is more volative than bitcoin. Most alternative cryptocurenices that we analyzed had a 30 day rolling beta consitently well above 1. 
## Which crypto assets have high volume/liquidity and does this correlate with the risk of the asset?  
Dogecoin has very high volume. Our initial assumtion on volume was that it could result a decreased risk of the asset. We did not find evidence to support this. 
## What are the simulated returns on our chosen crypto assets over the next year?  
Selecting a 10,000 investment distrubuted 40% Bitcoin, 30% Litcoin, 30% Ethereum are analysis and Monti Carlo Simulation deterined we have a 95% confidence that our investment will land roughly between $5000 and $22000. Roughly speaking the invest could either be cut in have or double in value. This speaks to the high risk of investing in crypto even if investing in the the most stable assests over the last year.
