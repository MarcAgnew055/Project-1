#Project Name: Count of Monti Crypto
#Project Members: Matt Pretel, Jacob Edelbrock, Gerald Howard, Marc Agnew 
#Project Description: Use API to pull 5-10 chosen crypto currency historical data sets. Perfrom a  analsyis on historical data to determine metrics 
such as beta against bitcoin, volativity, historical gain/loss etc. Peform time series analysis to find the best perfomers over 24 months. 
	- Present on dashboard
	- Allow user to input weighted distribution and run* (depends on complexity and time frame. This is nice to have for the project but will be phase 2 if time allows)
	- Run monti carlo simulation and display results in dashboard 
#Datasets: Alpaca API, transorm into dataframe, run analysis 
#Breakdown of tasks:
- Set up API to pull historical data on 10 cyrpto currencies 
	- Determine 10 crypto's to pull
- Build data frame used for time series and peformance analysis 
- Perform analytics and make anltyics file 
- Pull analytics into dashboard of top 5 performing cyrpto
- Configure Monti Carlo silulation allows variable weighted distribution of top 5 cryptos 
- Use monti carlo results to create visuals and display on second dashboard tab
